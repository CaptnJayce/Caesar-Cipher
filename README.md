# caesarcipher
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”.

Steps:\
    ❌ Take input for message to encrypt\
    ❌ Take input for shift value\
    ❌ Encode the message by transposing each letter along the alphabet by the shift value\
    ❌ Allow users to input messages to decrypt\
